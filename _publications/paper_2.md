title: "A coverage-based approach to recommendation diversity on similarity graph"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/fscore
excerpt: 'We consider the problem of generating diverse, personalized recommendations such that a small set of recommended items covers a broad range of the user's interests. We represent items in a similarity graph, and we formulate the relevance/diversity trade-off as finding a small set of unrated items that best covers a subset of items positively rated by the user. In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not rely on an explicit trade-off between a relevance objective and a diversity objective, as the estimations of relevance and diversity are implicit in the coverage criterion. We show on several benchmark datasets that our approach compares favorably to the state-of-the-art diversification methods according to various relevance and diversity measures.'
